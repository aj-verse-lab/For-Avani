  <h1>Letters I Can’t Send on WhatsApp</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Open them slowly. In any order.</div>

  <div class="envelope" onclick="openLetter(0)">
    <div class="title">When I miss you</div>
    <div class="letter">
      I miss you in the quietest way.<br><br>
      Not the kind that hurts, but the kind that lingers.
      The kind that makes me imagine you reading this and smiling softly.
      The kind that reminds me how naturally you have become a part of my days.
      Distance only makes me more sure of you.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="envelope" onclick="openLetter(1)">
    <div class="title">What I notice about you</div>
    <div class="letter">
      I notice how you make spaces warmer just by being in them.
      How people relax around you.
      How you listen with your whole heart.
      You do not try to be special.
      You just are.
      And I fall a little more every time I notice that.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="envelope" onclick="openLetter(2)">
    <div class="title">What I feel when you choose me</div>
    <div class="letter">
      When you choose me, even in small ways,
      it makes me want to protect that choice.
      To be gentle with you.
      To be steady.
      To make sure you always feel safe where you stand with me.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="envelope" onclick="openLetter(3)">
    <div class="title">What I imagine when I think of us</div>
    <div class="letter">
      I imagine calm mornings.
      Unnecessary laughter.
      Long conversations that do not need conclusions.
      Your head resting comfortably.
      My hand finding yours without thinking.
      A life that grows slowly, but deeply.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="envelope" onclick="openLetter(4)">
    <div class="title">What I want you to remember tonight</div>
    <div class="letter">
      You are not alone.
      You do not have to carry everything by yourself.
      You are allowed to rest.
      And somewhere, there is someone who is very glad you exist.
      That someone is me.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="envelope" onclick="openLetter(5)">
    <div class="title">The one thing I have not said enough</div>
    <div class="letter">
      Loving you does not feel dramatic.
      It feels certain.
      It feels calm.
      And it makes me want to meet you again,
      just to sit next to you and smile for no reason.
    </div>

    Made with quiet love 🤍
