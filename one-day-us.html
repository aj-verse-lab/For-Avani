<h1>One day, us 🤍</h1>

<p>
One day, there won’t be any planning.
No counting days.
No wondering.
</p>

<p>
Just mornings that start quietly.
Conversations that don’t need catching up.
Comfort that feels natural.
</p>

<p>
We won’t need to talk about effort.
It will already be there.
In how we move.
In how we care.
</p>

<p>
I don’t rush that future.
I respect it.
Because things that last
are worth waiting for.
</p>

<p>
And until then,
I’m here.
Choosing you.
Every day.
