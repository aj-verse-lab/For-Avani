<h1>A letter I never rushed 🤍</h1>

<p>
I never wanted to write something for you in a hurry.
Some feelings deserve time.
Space.
Stillness.
</p>

<p>
You are not someone I want to impress.
You are someone I want to understand.
And be understood by.
</p>

<p>
There is something about the way you move through the world.
Quiet strength.
Gentle awareness.
A softness that doesn’t disappear even when life asks more of you.
</p>

<p>
Being with you doesn’t feel like escape.
It feels like arriving.
Like something finally makes sense without needing explanation.
</p>

<p>
I don’t need grand moments with you.
I need the everyday ones.
The ordinary.
Because with you, even those feel meaningful.
</p>

<p>
This letter isn’t asking for anything.
It’s simply here to say:
I see you.
And I’m grateful you’re in my life.
</p>

<p>
Always gently,<br>
Me 🤍
