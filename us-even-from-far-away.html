    <h2>What has not changed</h2>
    <p>
      The way I think of you.
      The care I carry for you.
      The comfort I feel when I imagine you smiling.
      Distance has not touched any of that.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What I feel knowing you are there</h2>
    <p>
      I feel proud of you.
      I feel excited for everything you are doing.
      And yes, I miss you.
      Not in a way that feels heavy.
      In a way that reminds me how much you matter.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What we are doing right now</h2>
    <p>
      We are living our days.
      Growing in our own spaces.
      Carrying each other quietly.
      Choosing each other without needing constant proof.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What I am most sure about</h2>
    <p>
      That this distance is temporary.
      That what we are building is steady.
      And that when you come back,
      it will feel easy to fall back into us.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="divider">🤍</div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Until then</h2>
    <p>
      Take care of yourself.
      Rest when you need to.
      Live fully.
      And remember that there is someone here
      who feels close to you,
      no matter how far away you are.
